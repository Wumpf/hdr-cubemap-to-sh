![Raison d'Ãªtre](/very-descriptive-image.jpg)

**WARNING**: Quickly hacked together single purpose tool!  
All I needed is irradiance from some cubemaps I had around already.
For something more serious have a look at the source code of the quite amazing [Probulator](https://github.com/kayru/Probulator/)


How to use:  
`cargo run <somepath>`

Path must point to a directory containing the following files: "px.hdr", "nx.hdr", "py.hdr", "ny.hdr", "pz.hdr", "nz.hdr"  
All square, making up a cubemap together.
